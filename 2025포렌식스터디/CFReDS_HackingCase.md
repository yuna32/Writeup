[CFReDS] Hacking Case
========================



시나리오

```
 On 09/20/04, a Dell CPi notebook computer, serial # VLQLW, was found abandoned along with a wireless 
 PCMCIA card and an external homemade 802.11b antennae. It is suspected that this computer was used for 
 hacking purposes, although cannot be tied to a hacking suspect, G=r=e=g S=c=h=a=r=d=t. 
 (The equal signs are just to prevent web crawlers from indexing this name; there are no 
 equal signs in the image files.) Schardt also goes by the online nickname of 
 “Mr. Evil” and some of his associates have said that he would park his vehicle 
 within range of Wireless Access Points (like Starbucks and other T-Mobile Hotspots) 
 where he would then intercept internet traffic, attempting to get credit card numbers, 
 usernames & passwords. This test image requires a variety of skills to answer the given questions. 
 Find any hacking software, evidence of their use, and any data that might have been generated. 
 Attempt to tie the computer to the suspect, G=r=e=g S=c=h=a=r=d=t.
